                It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap
                into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the
                release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing
                software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

                "But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was 
                born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the 
                great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, 
                or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue 
                pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone 
                who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally 
                circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial 
                example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage 
                from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has 
                no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?"
